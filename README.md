## About
This project is a machine learning model that predicts Schengen Visa application outcomes based on the country where the consulate is located. It uses a Random Forest Classifier to make predictions.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/schengen-visa-predictor.git
Navigate to the project directory:

shell
Copy code
cd schengen-visa-predictor
Install the required Python packages:

shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Train the model using your own dataset or replace data.csv with your dataset.
Modify the code to suit your specific data and requirements.
Run the Python script to train and evaluate the model.
Use the trained model to predict visa application outcomes.
Data
The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

Schengen State
Country where consulate is located
Consulate
Airport transit visas (ATVs) applied for
...
You can replace this dataset with your own visa application data.

Model
The project uses a Random Forest Classifier for predicting visa application outcomes. You can explore other models and algorithms as needed for your specific use case.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using common regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) score.

Predicting Visa Application Outcomes
To predict a visa application outcome for a specific country where the consulate is located, you can:

Encode the country name using label encoding (if not already encoded in the dataset).
Use the trained model to predict the outcome.
Example:

python
Copy code
# Encode the input country
input_country = 'Your_Country_Name'
input_country_encoded = label_encoder.transform([input_country])

# Predict the outcome
predicted_outcome = classifier.predict([input_country_encoded])[0]
print(f"Predicted Visa Application Outcome for {input_country}: {predicted_outcome}")
